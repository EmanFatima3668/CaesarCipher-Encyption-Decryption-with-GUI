# CaesarCipher-Encyption-Decryption-with-GUI
# Caesar Cipher Encryption/Decryption Website

This is a simple and educational web application that demonstrates the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. The website provides information about the Caesar Cipher, explains how it works, and allows users to encrypt or decrypt text using a specified shift value.

## Features

- **About Caesar Cipher:** A brief history and explanation of the Caesar Cipher.
- **How It Works:** Detailed explanation with examples of how the cipher shifts letters.
- **Encryption/Decryption Tool:** An interactive form where users can input text and a shift value to encrypt or decrypt messages.
- **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and works well on desktop and mobile devices.
- **Stylish UI:** Uses a matrix-themed background and elegant styling for a modern look.

## How to Use

1. Open the `Caeser Cipher Website.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Navigate through the sections using the navigation bar at the top.
3. In the "Encrypt/Decrypt" section:
   - Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
   - Enter the shift value (an integer).
   - Click **Encrypt** to convert plaintext to ciphertext.
   - Click **Decrypt** to convert ciphertext back to plaintext.
4. The result will appear in the output text area below the buttons.

## Technical Details

- The Caesar Cipher function shifts each alphabetical character by the given number, preserving the case.
- Non-alphabetical characters remain unchanged.
- The shift wraps around the alphabet (e.g., shifting 'Z' by 1 results in 'A').
- The website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no external dependencies.
- The design includes responsive CSS for mobile and desktop compatibility.
